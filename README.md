# facPattern

This program is designed to test the Factory Method design pattern.

It requires three files:

Program.cs (contains the main driver)

GeometricShape.cs (contains the IGeometricShape interface and all associated classes)

ShapeFactory.cs (contains the implementation for getShape and the enumerators of ShapeType)

.

In a loop in main, the program will test for Line, Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle

(only triangle is not implemented for testing with getShape on null)
